<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Through this industry talk 1 by Clarity Techworks, I was able to learn a lot of different jobs and position in Computer Science field. For example, Android Developer, UI / UX Designer, QA Testing Analysis and Web Developer. The improvement that I would like to suggest is I would like the workers in Clarity Techworks Singapore to share their experience too because there are only workers in Clarity Techworks Malaysia sharing their experience during the industry talk. When completing this assignment, I was able to learn how to create a poster by using Canva with the help of my teammates. It was fun because this is my first time to create a poster. </p>
